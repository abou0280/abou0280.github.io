            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>My name is Youmna Aboulchaar and I am 21 years old.<br>I am a student at Algonquin College, studying <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> have some background in art from my highschool years. <br>I chose this program so I could increase my knowledge and skill on incorporating art into the digital space. <br>As I believe it will help give me new opportunities, and to encourage me to strive to learn and achieve new things in life.</p>

            <h2>My Background</h2>

            <p>I don't have any prior experience with coding, graphic design, or photography coming into this program.<br> Which can be a bit challenging to learn to create art in a completely different form than before.<br> Previously in school, I made visual art using a few different art mediums such as drawing, painting, sketching and even pottery. <br>In this program I hope to use some of the knowledge acquired from past learning experiences to not only help give me <br>insight in the way art is implemented in this program.<br>But also to inspire me to develop my own new experiences in this unfamiliar but intriguing way of creating art. </p>
